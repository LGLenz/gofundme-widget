# Elias — GoFundMe Fundraising Page

This is a professional-looking static webpage to help raise funds for my part-time selfsponsored, distance learning Cybersecurity PhD via GoFundMe.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages

1. Create a **new public repository** on GitHub (e.g., `gofundme-widget`).
2. Upload `index.html` and this `README.md` to the repository root.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set:
   - **Source**: `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch**: `main` and **/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**. After a minute, your site will be available at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

You can also host this on **Netlify** or **Vercel** by drag-and-dropping `index.html`.
